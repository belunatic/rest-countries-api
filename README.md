## How It's Made

**Tech used:** TypeScript, HTML, CSS

This project was built using TypeScript for type-safe logic and modular structure, HTML for semantic layout, and CSS for styling. It integrates with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to fetch real-time country data including flags, population, region, capital, and more.

Users can:

- Search for a country by name using the search bar
- Filter countries by continent/region
- Click on a country to view more details on a dedicated `detail.html` page
- Toggle between light and dark mode for a personalized viewing experience

The interface is optimized for clarity and mobile responsiveness, making it easy to use across devices.

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

- Fetching and handling external API data with TypeScript
- Dynamically filtering and rendering content based on user input
- Implementing dark/light mode toggling using CSS and JavaScript
- Structuring modular, maintainable code with clear separation of concerns
- Designing intuitive user interfaces with semantic HTML and responsive CSS

Country Explorer reflects the power of simple tools built with purpose. Itâ€™s a foundation for more advanced educational platforms and interactive data visualizations to come.
